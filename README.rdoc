== Welcome to Euro 2012 Score Simulator

This was a 3 day project to implement a simple ruby app to simulate the ranking
of Group teams given their possible results.
It was not originally the ideia to turn this in to a rails app so considerable
parts of the implementation needed for this purpose were disregarded, never the
less, it is barely usable at this moment.

Feel free to fork and make improvements.
